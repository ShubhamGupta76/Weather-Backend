- [x] Edit `WeatherController.java` to add a new GET endpoint `/welcome` that logs request metadata (method and path) and returns a JSON welcome message.
- [x] Run Maven tests (`mvn test`) to generate Jacoco test coverage report in HTML format.
- [x] Launch browser to display the generated HTML coverage report at `file:///e:/weather-App/target/site/jacoco/index.html`.
- [x] Commit the code changes to the repository.
- [x] Report the completion of the task.
